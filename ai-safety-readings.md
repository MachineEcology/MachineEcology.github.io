We run a regular reading group on AI Safety research. We discuss recent papers on interpretability, alignment, multi-agent safety, and related topics — from mechanistic interpretability to broader governance perspectives. Everyone is welcome, regardless of background.

The reading group is currently held on Mondays at 14:00 Copenhagen time.
Email us at <a href="mailto:galke@imada.sdu.dk">galke@imada.sdu.dk</a> if you want to join or have any questions.
